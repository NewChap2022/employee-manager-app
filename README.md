## Technologies
Node.js; Inquirer; MySQL; Console Table

## Reflection
It takes me some time to figure out how to build a promise chain so that the menu can show after retriving data from MySQL. This is a challenging task. Keep code DRY is not easy to manage. It helps me understand MySQL better.
